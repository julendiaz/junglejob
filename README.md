## Overview

This is the first assignment from the Javascript course on The Odin Project. The main task was to build a kind of Library App to store all the books that you are reading. Instead of going for the simpler route, giving the case that I am currently actively looking for a job, I wanted to build a job board to keep track of all the applications.

With a little bit of research, I saw a few other apps out there with a similar idea with the one I had. For educational purposes, I really do not aspire to create a fully fledge application. In that case, I will keep it simple and use it as a way of learning about Object-Oriented Programming and the curiosity of how to create kanban boards.

## The Challenge

- [ ] Build a job board to store all job applications
- [ ] Use Object-Oriented Programming for new Applications
- [ ] Create the Kanban feature to grap each application
- [ ] Create an home-made illustration for the thumbnail
- [ ] Use an API for the logos
- [ ] Have fun

## Key Features

- Add new Job Applications
- Be able to transfer Applications from one stage into another (Kanban)
- Add 3 simple data for each application (Business, Position, Location)
- Search for the logo of the Business with an API
- Scroll infinitely in each stage

## My Process

> Thinking like a Programmer is about having fun with problem-solving

### Understand the problem

### Pseudocode

After reading the first chapter of the book "Think like a programmer", I wanted to put in practice that philosophy of "Always have a plan". For this purpose, I spend a few hours researching and thinking about the best way to implement each feature in plain english.

```

```

Obviously, after coding for a while, I had to re-arrange blocks and come up with solutions for a few other problems. Overall, it really helped me with speeding up the workflow.

### Mindmap

After finishing up the pseudocode method, I thought that some parts were a bit confusing to digest for my current level. That's why I tried to express each solution and function into a simple mindmap. This way I could visualize all the co-relations between variables and organize all of the ideas.

This is the first solution I came up with before any code was written. Even though it was a good start and helped me a lot in visualizing the funcion callings, I had to re-arrange lots of thinks in order to work it out.
